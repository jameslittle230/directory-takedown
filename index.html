      <p>Hey James,</p>
      <p>
        I'm encouraged by your creativity with making your own Bowdoin
        Directory. But there is a reason why we put CORS restrictions on the API
        which you have handily bypassed with your reverse proxy. Our Directory
        takes some care in curating the data it displays and there are questions
        of privacy when that data is displayed in a way that it was not
        intended. We can get more creative on our side to restrict that access
        further, but I figured I'd start with a simple email your way to ask
        that you stop using it and our images. In a more perfect world, we'd
        have a solid public API for you to access, but that kind of project is
        not currently a priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        So tldr; please stop using the Bowdoin Directory private API and images.
      </p>
